## list of projects 

- description, goal, next 
- people/teams that claim one means that they will work on it and be first author on paper that we write about it this year 
- will involve some data munging, some analysis, possibly some novel methods development
- will be the top research priority for people who claim it
- will visit the data generators in next month or so to get more details / make more plans
- goal is to submit nature paper nlt end of calendar year

- mouse single cell ophys 
- $>$6,300 cells
- 40k time steps 
- time-varying stimulus

<br>


- goal: estimate time-varying intrinsic dimension and/or amount of information brain data has about stimulus
- next: run URerF on data, 
- next: extend RerF to support multivariate regression 

.footnote[meghana?]

### hillman (columbia)

- mouse wide field ophys
- 512 x 512 times for several thousand time steps 
- i don't think we have stimulus 

<br>


- goal: estimate time-varying intrinsic dimension and/or amount of information brain data has about stimulus
- next: parallel/distributed implementation of RerF/URerF 

.footnote[meghana?]

- 2 sexes, 2 connectomes each 
- brain across sexes are partially matched 
- cell lineage for each neuron 

<br>

- next: run hclust on data


.footnote[pedigo?]

### drosophila bilateral homology (janelia/cambridge)

- left and right mushroom bodies 

<br>

### HCP data (milham, nyc)

- ~1000 subjects human dMRI graphs 
- mono, di, sib

<br>


- goal: quantify heritability 
- next: update draft? formalize our notion of heritability? is it  discriminability?

.footnote[jaewon]

### sea lion and coyote  (berns, atlana / milham, nyc)

- 4 sea lions and 4 coyotes 
- dMRI graph and atlas from each 

<br>


- goal: compare and contrast 
- next: do it 

.footnote[nobody?]

### brazilian child study (milham, nyc)

- several thousand kids 
- PRS for each 
- some brain imaging data for each 

<br>


- goal: determine which "features" of brain data are associated with which PRS
- next: get data into "shape"

.footnote[nobody?]


---

### human cci (milham, nyc)

- HBN + HCP data including dMRI covariates
- run signal subgraph on one dataset to find signal subgraph for some covariate 
- once found for one dataset, run the same exact code on the other dataset, to find approximately same signal subgraph 

<br>


goal: find signal subgraph robust to site specific batch effects
next: get data organized 

.footnote[nobody?]

---

### human batch effects

- 15-20 differnet dMRI and fMRI datasets
- age and sex covariates for each
- graphs already estimated for all

<br>


goal: characterize the magnitude of the batch effects
next: run graph-mgc to test for differences between batches

logistics

- would be at kavli 
- i'd get money for food 
- people will pay for travel/lodging 
- would need committment from
      - one person to run each day
      - one person to run overall thingy 
- would have to start planning asap 
- would have to find a week that works for those committed asap
